The project succesfully implements the concepts of the SQLite database and the shared prefferences to create the database of the 
instored contacts. All the detials of the contacts are been saved in the database helper class.
Primarly the splash screen will occur which is been implemented using the threads.
Then after that there is a state checker mechanism which checks the state of the PIN mechanism that whether the PIN is already present 
in the system or not.
If the value of the PIN is already there then the mechanism directly shifts the enter pin activity and if not then the mechanism takes
the control to the create PIN activity.
The state of the PIN and the values like teh PIN itself and the emergency PIN reset value is stored in a shared prefference which is present 
in  a seperate class.
The once the user sets up the PIN and emergency key word to reset password. The user is asked to again enter PIN for secure login.
If the user chooses to reset the PIN the user is asked the emergency password to reset the PIN.
And if the user inputs the right data then it directs the user to the enter PIN activity again.
Now after login initially there is no data stored in the database hence the user will have to add data using the floating buttons with
add symbol. Which will invoke an alert dialog through which the user can enter the data and save it on the database.
Once the save the the input is invoked the dispaly dunction is also invoked which will certainly refresh the given list view 
with the newly added data.
There are many more features that are gonna be added soon in this project, like connectivity with the whatsapp and paytm,
user uplaod their pictures and add notes for the individual person in teh contact.
